    "### 1. **Two-Pointer Approach (Optimized for fewer writes)**\n",
    "Instead of copying non-`val` elements to the beginning, we can swap `val` elements with the last valid element. This reduces unnecessary writes to the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:\n",
    "        left = 0\n",
    "        right = len(nums) - 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        while left <= right:\n",
    "            if nums[left] == val:\n",
    "                # Swap the current element with the last valid element\n",
    "                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]\n",

    "                left += 1\n",
    "        return left\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- Use two pointers: `left` starts at the beginning, and `right` starts at the end.\n",
    "- When `nums[left]` equals `val`, swap it with `nums[right]` and decrement `right`.\n",
    "- If `nums[left]` is not equal to `val`, simply increment `left`.\n",
    "- This avoids unnecessary writes for elements that are already in the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity:\n",
